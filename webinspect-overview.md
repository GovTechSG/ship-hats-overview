# Fortify WebInspect

Fortify WebInspect is a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tool that will execute a series of security probes against a running web application in order to identify potential security vulnerabilities.

WebInspect Enterprise (WIE) integrates with Microfocus SSC, where SSC provides a single and unified interface for managing security vulnerabilities for both WebInspect and Fortify SCA. Scans in WIE are made against a Fortify SSC application version and results are automatically uploaded to SSC after every scan execution.


Fortify WebInspect provides the following features:
- Identify vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs while they are running in production.
- Support for the latest web technologies and pre-configured policies for major compliance regulations.
- Monitor trends and use dynamic analysis to take action on vulnerabilities.
