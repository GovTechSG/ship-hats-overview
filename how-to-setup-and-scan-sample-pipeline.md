# How to set up a simple pipeline to check out and scan the sample application
This tutorial is to guide you in implementing the SHIP-HATS CI Pipeline into your workflow for a sample application.

## What is a CI Pipeline?
A Continuous Integration(CI) pipeline is a series of steps to automate code merge allowing development teams to merge frequently. These steps will include a trigger to initiate a build and a test sequence automatically which uncovers errors early in the software development lifecycle.
