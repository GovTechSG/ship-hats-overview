# How to set up a simple pipeline to check out and scan the sample application
This tutorial is to guide you in setting up a simple pipeline to check out and scan the sample application in SHIP-HATS.

## What is a CI Pipeline?
Continuous Integration(CI) is a software engineering approach where developers merge the code into a shared code repository and then verified by automated build and testing.

## Prerequisites
1. You must have Bitbucket, Bamboo, Nexus IQ and Nexus Repository added to your project.  If not, please contact your Project Admin to get the required access.

2. You must have “write access” to the projects created on the above-mentioned tools. If not, please contact your Project Admin to get the required access.

3. You must have a basic understanding of the SHIP-HATS CI Tools (Bitbucket, Bamboo, Nexus IQ and Nexus Repository)

## Setting up a simple pipeline to check out and scan the sample application in SHIP-HATS

### Step 1 of 6: Fork Repo to Bitbucket
Bitbucket is a source code management tool. Source code for your application is hosted within a Bitbucket repository. A Bitbucket project contains one or more repositories.  

Normally, an application development team will create an empty repository and check in their code. For this tutorial, we will make use of existing code. We will create a new repository by forking from another repository.

## Step 2 of 6: Integrating Bitbucket to Bamboo
As your code repo is in Bitbucket, we need to integrate it into Bamboo to allow and automate testing of the code/application. Bamboo is essentially a build tool that allows constant merging, testing of code  which allows  development teams to receive rapid feedback on their work.

## Step 3 of 6: Adding a Bamboo Trigger
Adding a Bamboo Trigger is required so that Bamboo is notified whenever there is a code change in any of the selected source code repositories.
