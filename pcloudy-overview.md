### Prerequisites
- The user must be a Project Admin (PA) in order to retrieve the pCloudy token from the SHIP-HATS Self Help Portal.
- Make sure that your bamboo plan has an elastic image configuration of the HATS security agent dedicated to it (check with the HATS team)

### Retrieving PCloudy Token
To use the pCloudy CLI in bamboo, you would need to retrieve your pCloudy token from your pCloudy application from the SHIP-HATS Self Help portal.

1. Login to the SHIP-HATS Self Help Portal (https://www.ship.gov.sg)
1. Click Projects on the left side bar, "All Projects" and "Manage" on the project that your pCloudy application is in. If your pCloudy application is already created, you can jump to step 5. If you want to create a new pCloudy application, go to step 3.

    <kbd>![All Projects]()


### Set up your Bamboo Plan

After you have your pCloudy token, you can use the pCloudy CLI in your bamboo plans, to book and release devices on pCloudy.

You can also use the pCloudy CLI to upload files to pCloudy.

### Upload Files
You can use the pCloudy CLI to upload files to pCloudy, with the command: `pcloudy-cli upload-file`. This is an optional step.

This is mainly used to upload your application to pCloudy for testing.

- You need your token for this command
- The name of the uploaded file may be different from the original name of the file
- The file cannot be empty
- The file can only have the extensions of `.zip` , `.apk`, or `.ipa`. 
- The name of the file may only contain the alphanumeric characters and ( `-` , `_` , `.` ) characters

The required options are:
- --pcloudy-token, -P
- --file, -f

<!-- tabs:start -->
### **Command Format**

```
pcloudy-cli upload-file -P <your pCloudy Token> -f <Path to file to upload>
``` 
 
**Example: Upload a test build of an Android application to pCloudy**
```
pcloudy-cli upload-file -P "$token" -f artifacts/test_build_12_21.apk
```

### **Output Format**

If successful, the command would exit successfully with a stdout of:

```
{"uploaded_filename": "STRING"}
```

**Example pcloudy-cli upload-file -P "$token" -f artifacts/test_build_12_21.apk**
```
>> {"uploaded_filename": "test_build_12_21-1637507508.apk"}
```

You can then use a tool like `jq`  or `awk`  or `grep`  to get the data you want out of the stdout.

<!-- tabs:end -->







### Book Device
Regardless of whether you upload your test file or not to pCloudy, you can use the pCloudy CLI to book a device for testing.

- You need your token for this command
- This command will return you the rid  (used for releasing the booked device early) and the api_endpoint (the appium endpoint you would use to run your robots tests)
- You can choose between browser testing or application testing  

The required options are:
- --pcloudy-token, -P
- --duration, -d
- --platform, -p

Ensure that at least one of these options are used to set the test type of the booked device:
- --app-name, -a
- --browser, -b

Optional options:
- --platform-version
- --device-name

### Run your tests
**Sample Test Script**  

After booking the device (and optionally uploading your apk file), you can run additional commands to perform your pCloudy tests. In this case, we are using Robot Framework as the testing framework in this example.

In this test script, we are running mobile browser testing.
This script is saved into a test file named `test.txt`.


<details>

Note that the sample APK file is already uploaded with the name of `pCloudyAppiumDemo.apk`

- If you upload a package file with the same filename, the filename will be appended with a random numerical identifier by default - e.g, ` pCloudyAppiumDemo-1638321800.apk`
- Value of the APP_PACKAGE use `com.pcloudy.appiumdemo`

### Download Tests Logs
After your tests are complete you can also download the logs from pCloudy using the pcloudy-cli download-logs-data  command. This is an optional step.

- You will need your pCloudy Token and `rid`  used to book the device
- The logs will also be based on the tests ran on the booked device
- Log files will be downloaded into the bamboo agent, where you can persist them by saving them as bamboo artifacts.

<details>
<summary><b>Command Format</b></summary>

```
pcloudy-cli download-logs-data -P <your pCloudy Token> -r <rid string when the device was booked>
``` 
 
**Example: Download the logs of tests ran on booked device with rid of 52485**
```
pcloudy-cli download-logs-data -P "$token" -r 52485
```
 </details>



If successfuly, the command would exit successfully with a stdout of:

<details>
<summary><b>Output Format</b></summary>

```
{"success_logs": ["STRING", ...], "failed_logs": ["STRING", ...]}
```

**Example**
```
pcloudy-cli download-logs-data -P "$token" -r 52485
>> {"success_logs": [".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/cpu.txt", ".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/mem.txt", ".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/net.txt", ".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/bat.txt", ".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/appium_stdout.txt", ".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/appium_stderr.txt"], "failed_logs: [".pcloudy_appium_logs/52485/log.txt"]}
```
 </details>

The downloaded logs will be stored in the current project's directory , in the bamboo agent, with a format of:  

 <details>
<summary><b>Directory Sturcture Format</b></summary>

```
./.pcloudy_appium_logs
|-- rid (NUMBER)
|   |-- *.txt (log files)
|   `-- ...
`-- ...
```


**Example**
```
./.pcloudy_appium_logs
`-- 52485
    |-- appium_stderr.txt
    |-- appium_stdout.txt
    |-- bat.txt
    |-- cpu.txt
    |-- log.txt
    |-- mem.txt
    `-- net.txt
```

 </details>

### Release Device
After your tests are complete and you want to release the booked device, you can run the pcloudy-cli release-device  command.

- You will need to use the same token and rid  when booking the device

## Automated Testing
Please refer to [pCloudy CLI](https://confluence.ship.gov.sg/x/Foo4IQ) tool to get started with mobile automated testing.

If you need technical assistance on connecting to pcloudy devices, please raise a service request [here](https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/create/149).

## Manual Testing
### Prerequisites
To access the [pCloudy web dashboard](https://hats.pcloudy.com), make sure you have the following:
- SHIP VPN
- Internet access and Firefox browser/ Firefox Developer Edition browser, preferably on a non-government issued laptop/ development laptop
- The required proxy configuration will be provided during on-boarding.

As the dashboard can only be accessed via the proxy:
- We strongly recommend the use of Firefox browser as it is tied to browser-level settings. If Chrome is used, it will affect the system-level settings.
- Please note that only pCloudy site will be accessible, all other Internet sites are blocked. Unauthorized access to other websites are being monitored and logged.

>**Notes:**
>- Applicable for users doing manual testing - the account password will expire every year.
>- The current video format provided is in FLV. The pCloudy team is working on making the default video format to be MP4.
>- The devices in pCloudy are not meant to be used to develop functional testing script. Please use emulators/simulators from Android Studio and Xcode for respective OS.
>- When installing an app on an iOS device the app has to be re-signed with the UDID of the device. If you are unable to do the automated resigning, then you can resign manually using the UDID. You can copy the UDID and paste it in your Apple Developer account to resign manually
>- Please raise a service ticket for us to dedicate a Linux elastic agent to your Bamboo plan. The  elastic agent dedicated would have pcloudy-cli and another required packages installed.
>- When developing your functional testing scripts with Robot Framework, please do note the versions of Python and the following packages:  
    >- Appium Server, v1.19
    >- Python, v3.8.5 and above
    >- Robot Framework, v3.2.2 OR pabot, v1.10.0

### Usage of Pabot

Pabot allows parallel execution of tests. However, there is a known issue where the path of the embedded screenshots in the log file does not align with the filepath of the screenshots taken when tests fail. They are stored under the `pabot_results/` folder instead.

We strongly encouraged you to use Robot Framework i.e. `robot` command, where the screenshots are well embedded into the HTML report generated.
