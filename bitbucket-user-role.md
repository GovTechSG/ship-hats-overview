# Atlassian Bitbucket – Roles and Permissions

You can use Bitbucket as a centralised place to manage your project source code repositories for an efficient source code management. <a href="https://docs.developer.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats/#/user-roles-permisions">SHIP-HATS Project Admin (PA)</a> can add Atlassian Bitbucket to a SHIP-HATS project. 
 
### Bitbucket user roles and permissions
Once you add Bitbucket as your project tool, a Bitbucket project is created. Please refer to <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver0711/using-project-permissions-1047557542.html">Bitbucket Project Permissions</a> to know more about the possible permissions for users added to the project. 

### SHIP-HATS - Bitbucket role mapping
| SHIP-HATS | Bitbucket |
| :-------- | --------- |
| Project Admin | Administrator for the project. </br> This role is assigned by default when Bitbucket is added to the SHIP-HATS project. Administrator can assign project roles to other users and there can be more than one Administrator. |
| Users | SHIP-HATS users can be assigned as an administrator or added as user to the project. |

### Bitbucket Users
You can add and manage users as <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PYAcEbNSGqEJn1yej1qq3iHvjmwqjHt4/edit#heading=h.tyjcwt">individual users</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PYAcEbNSGqEJn1yej1qq3iHvjmwqjHt4/edit#heading=h.3dy6vkm">group</a>. Administrator can view project permissions assigned for users and groups.

*To view project permissions:*
![bitbucket](bitbucket.png)

1. In <a href="https://bitbucket.ship.gov.sg">SHIP Bitbucket</a>, go to Projects and choose your project. 

1. Click ![settings](settings.png)**Project settings**. Note that if you do not have Admin permissions, you will not be able to view this option.

1. From the sidebar, select **Project permissions**. You will be able to view the **Project permissions**.

### Bitbucket User access
Administrator can add users individually and manage their permissions.

### Bitbucket Group access 
Groups are an easier and efficient way to manage user access for multiple users.  Users can raise a <a href="https://jira.ship.gov.sg/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/">service request</a> with the required group name, project name and user details such as name and email address. Crowd administrator in the SHIP-HATS team evaluates the request and approves it accordingly.  

If approved, the group is created with the agency name prefixed to it. For example, MOE-BCAS. If a group was already created for managing users in any one of the Atlassian products added to your project on SHIP-HATS, you would be able to see that in all the integrated Atlassian products. Bitbucket project administrators can manage user groups for the project.
