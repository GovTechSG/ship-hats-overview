## Create new projects

Subscription Admin (SA) can create new projects in SHIP-HATS and manage them. SAs assign Project Admins (PA). Both SA and PA can manage the projects by adding project tools and add users.

### To create a new project

1. From the side menu, click **Projects** > **Create New**.  

    >**Tip:** Alternatively, if you are viewing **All Projects**, click **Create Project**.  

    <kbd>![create-new-project](create-new-project-2.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

1. Provide information in the following fields:

    |Field|Description|
    |---|---|
    | **Project Name** |Specify name of the project. 
    |**Project Description**| Specify details of the project. 
    |**Project Admin 1**| Select Project Admin from the drop-down list. If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list.
    |**Project Admin 2**| This is an optional field. Select a second Project Admin from the drop-down list. If *First Name* and *Last Name* were not provided when creating a new user account, email address will appear in the drop-down list. 
1. Click **Create Project**. The created project details are displayed as shown below.

    <kbd>![newly-created-project](newly-created-project.png ':size=100%')</kbd>

## Add project admins

Subscription Admins can add Project Admins using the SHIP-HATS portal. When creating a project in an account, it is mandatory to specify at least one Project Admin. SAs can add any additional PAs anytime in the future.  

> **Note:** The number of PAs each project is entitled to is based on the [subscription tier](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/subscription) quota for which the agency has subscribed.
