# Bamboo Overview

Bamboo helps you build a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline. 

- Continuous Integration enables constant merging and testing of code, which leads to finding defects early and saves time on fixing merge issues. Development teams also receive rapid feedback on their work.
- Continuous Delivery enables you to deliver software solutions to production and testing environments to help organizations quickly fix bugs and respond to ever-changing business requirements. Bamboo provides following features:
    - Automated building and testing of software
    - Reporting tools for statistical analysis
    - Visibility info, and control over release artifacts and environments
