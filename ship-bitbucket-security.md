# Security for Bitbucket

Security for Bitbucket is a plugin that automatically rejects all Git commits containing hardcoded secrets (for example, credentials, keys, hooks, or tokens) from being pushed to your Bitbucket repository. This plugin helps to ensure that your source code repository does not contain any hardcoded secrets in the source code that should not be pushed into the Bitbucket repository.

## Whitelisting detected secrets

If hardcoded credentials are detected, tenants should either remove them from source code, or if **absolutely necessary**, whitelist each secret on a case-by-case basis. This can be done by adding an inline comment appended to the end of the link containing the secret with the comment *pragma: allowlist secret*. For example, a whitelisted secret in Python would look like the following:

```
    def hello():
        db_pass = \"thisismydbpasswd\" \# pragma: allowlist secret
```

>**Note:** the comment is an inline comment (this means that it is on the same line as the hardcoded secret in question, not on a separate line) and is appended to the end of the line containing the secret.
