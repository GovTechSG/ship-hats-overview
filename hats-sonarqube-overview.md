# SonarQube

SonarQube is an automatic code review tool to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smell. We support two versions of SonarQube:
- Sonarqube Community Edition
- Sonarqube Developer Edition

<!-- CODEX-53275 (PORTAL-2287) -->
<!--By default, SonarQube Community edition is available with all the tier subscription (except starter). If you want to have the flexibilty to choose between the Community and Developer editions, you can buy the add-on of Basic languages. As a Subscription Administrator (SA), this will allow you to choose which edition you want to use for the new app. The following table provides two examples:  

|**Tier**|**Default Edition**|**Change after Add-on**|
|---|---|---|
|Squad|Community edition|You can choose between Community and Developer edition for subsequent new apps|
|Starter|Community edition|You can choose between Community and Developer edition for subsequent new apps|

As an SA, after you have bought the add-on, you cannot remove the add-on if you are using the Developer edition in your subscription. You will need to remove all Developer edition apps before you can downgrade and remove the add-on. -->
