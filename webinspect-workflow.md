## Prerequisites

Agency and Application must onboard WIE (via HATS Service Request) to use. 

- Fortify Application & Application Version to be accessible in WIE
    - Existing Fortify Applications to use WebInspect shall be specified in the HATS Service Request
- Static URL (hostname/IP addresses) where web application will be hosted for scanning. This must be publicly accessible from Internet.
    - Specify in HATS service request to place URLs in whitelist.
    - Our outgoing IP is 18.139.238.157
- Provision WIE users to manage Fortify applications in WIE
    - Only users that want to perform scans on WIE will require a user role in WIE ([WebInspect User Access Control](webinspect-user-access-control))
    - There are two roles offered to agencies in WIE:
        - **User:** A user can perform scans, cannot delete scans.
        - **Manager:** A manager can perform and delete scans.
    - We suggest that agencies only assign **Manager** role to a maximum of 2 users whom you want to provide the *Delete* access.

## Set up Initial Scan

### Audience
- These steps should be performed by someone intimately familiar with the Web Application under test, such as an Application Security Tester or a Security Lead.


### To set up initial scan:
1. Configure a scan to create a suitable configuration for scanning the Web Application and to save that configuration to be reused for repeated scans.
2. Create a reusable scan template for scanning the web app.
3. Verify that the scan configuration adequately tests the Web Application (that is all endpoints are hit or pages are crawled). 

## Integrate Scans in a CI Pipeline

### To integrate the scans:
1. Execute repeatable WebInspect scans using the scan template.
1. Operate the [WebInspect scans via the WebInspect API](webinspect-scan-via-api).

## Review Vulnerabilities

WebInspect scan results are immediately uploaded to SSC after each run. Vulnerabilities should be reviewed and analysed directly in SSC.

>**Note:** Vulnerabilities stemming from WebInspect can be identified in SSC by the field **Analysis Type = WebInspect**.
