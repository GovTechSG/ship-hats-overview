### 25 Oct 2021
In the view of improving our service capability and operation efficiency, SHIP-HATS will be performing phase-1 Bamboo plans clean-up activities by deleting suspended or disabled plans (older than a year ago). Additionally,  we will contact high usage tenants separately to assist them on Plan expiry configurations and housekeeping settings.

We seek your help to housekeep the older plans at your end. On 10th Nov ‘21,  disabled plans older than 1 year will be deleted.  As we continually seek to improve our solutions, we encourage you to refer to the [Bamboo Plans - Housekeep best practices](https://confluence.ship.gov.sg/display/SHIP/Bamboo+clean+up+and+best+practices) – the confluence page documentation with more details.   

 
#### FAQs

**1. What if I want to keep one or few of disabled plans for our future reference?**
We strongly recommend you to housekeep them at your local environment. However you can still change the configuration at SHIP-HATS Bamboo system by updating the plan from disabled to enable state.

**2. Will there be any notification send to agency what are all the disabled plans were terminated?**
No notification will be sent to the agency. Please work with your project admin and do necessary housekeeping actions.

**3.What are all the resources will be removed by deleting the suspended or disabled plans?**
Deleting a plan completely removes from SHIP-HATS Bamboo system. FYI deleting a plan also delete its branch plans from Bamboo. [Note: If your source code(s) configured in Bitbucket repo and branch, no impact to these linked bitbucket repos]. Kindly review all your disabled / suspended plans and contact us if you have any concern before 10th Nov ‘21.

**4. I have bamboo plans configured in SHIP-HATS; Am I able to delete or housekeep the plans by myself?**
Yes. Users with “Admin” permission to the project plans; able to perform Delete Plan action. If not, please work with the Project admin for the requested.
Do you have any recommended Bamboo Plan configurations for SHIP-HATS plans?
Tenants are expected not to keep more than 10 last builds per plan. After successful build, the plan resources (eg, artifacts, build logs) expiry should keep as minimal as possible. Our default recommended expiry is after 3 days of build and release artifacts.
 

Agencies are reminded NOT to override the default SHIP-HATS Bamboo Plan configuration for any of your plans. Please contact us if you need any exemption or assist from us.

SHIP-HATS will be implementing an Authenticated Request Limits (Throttling Policy) to Bitbucket service for all tenants, which will take effect from 15th  Sep 2021. This Policy is aimed at improving service stability and performance improvement.

In the view of recent utilization of bitbucket usage patterns, a token bucket algorithm will be introduced to bitbucket users consuming the services. As we continually seek to improve our solutions, we encourage you to refer to the Bitbucket Rate Limiting – the Atlassian documentation with more details.  

**Bitbucket Rate Limiting Policy**

Find below the guideline for tenants with this Rate limiting setting turned ON.
| **Guideline** | **Action Required** |
| --| -- |
|1. From 15 Sep ‘21 onwards, Rate limiting will be imposed and token bucket size and token bucket fill rate configured with the default settings.  | Review your build plans and requests regularly. If you are receiving returned error code 429 (ie when too many requests in a given amount of time);  look for the below options to mitigate the impact of rate-limiting </br> - Suggest users to review their code/scripts that the requests are not made in large bursts. </br> - Spread your requests. Use multiple users and split repos to perform the request rather than stick with one user. </br> - Cache API calls for at least a few seconds, and try to avoid making repetitive API calls. </br> - Avoid tight loops by writing scripts that wait for each REST request to finish before a new one is fired.</br> </br>If any of the above doesn’t help, please reach out to us SHIP-HATS Service Desk for further advice. |
| 2. Agencies with reasonable bitbucket requests as standard operational. | Nil |
| 3. Agencies are reminded NOT to perform load test or massive requests. | Nil. You will be receiving 429 returned error if your requests exceeded the rate limit configured and do necessary mitigation |

There is currently no way for end-users to check this. If you experience any issues due to any integration of plugins or tools, contact SHIP-HATS Service Desk team to assess and advise on it.  

**2. Will there be any notification send to agency when rate limit is exceeded?**

No notification will be sent for termination. Please monitor your build plans and responses received on the requests at your end.

**3. Shall I request to increase the rate limit?**

SHIP-HATS will not recommend to increase the rate limit which will have an impact to system stability and performance. Perhaps you may try out the possible mitigation options shared above to reduce the impact. You can reach out to us to assess your use cases and suggest further.

### 19 July 2021
SHIP-HATS will be implementing a Fair Usage Policy for the use of Bamboo Elastic Agents, which will take effect from 1st Aug 2021. This Policy is aimed at improving the developer experience so that all our users can run their Bamboo plans in a timely manner.

**Feedback on Bamboo Agent Utilisation**

We reviewed feedback that we have received through various channels such as the DevSatisfaction Survey, and via service tickets that you have raised. We found that common feedback centered around the unavailability of bamboo agents. Since then, we have been monitoring the bamboo agent usage patterns and have been able to work with some of you to spread out your jobs so that most jobs can be picked up quickly. In addition, we have put in place some monitoring tools to centrally monitor bamboo agent utilisation on a regular basis.

**New Fair Usage Policy**

To further reduce bamboo agent waiting times, we are putting in place a Fair Usage Policy with the following guidelines:

| **Guideline** | **Action Required** |
| --| -- |
| From 1 Aug ‘21 onwards, in order to free up resources for the next build, builds taking more than 500 minutes will be terminated automatically without any notification. | Review build plans regularly and reach out to the Service Desk for any specific use-cases that require more than 500 minutes.  We will assess the need on a case-by-case basis. |
|  2. Agencies are recommended to run jobs in their own CI/CD pipeline, only schedule jobs when necessary during low peak hours. | Nil |
|  3. Agencies are reminded NOT to perform load tests using elastic bamboo agents. | Nil |

As we continually seek to improve our solutions, we encourage you to refer to the confluence page, [Bamboo Elastic Agents – Fair Usage guideline](https://confluence.ship.gov.sg/display/SHIP/Bamboo+elastic+agents+-+fair+usage+guideline) for the **latest** Fair Usage Policy guidelines.

**Questions?**

**2. Will there be any notification send to the agency when the build plan is terminated?**

No notification will be sent for termination. Please monitor your build plans regularly and contact us if you require any support.
