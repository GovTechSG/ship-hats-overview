<details>
  <summary>2. Can I use a Remote agent?</summary><br>

A <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/confeval/development-tools-evaluator-resources/bamboo/bamboo-remote-agents-and-local-agents">Remote agent</a> requires hosting, agent installation and/or VPN installation (if required). Registration of Remote agent is subjected to approval by SHIP-HATS team. Please send a service request via SHIP-HATS service desk for registration of Remote Agent.
  
  </details>

<details>
  <summary>3. When does my project require a Dedicated Remote agent?</summary><br>

If your build job needs to connect back to your own resources or run parallel job, you can consider adding a Dedicated Remote agent.For more information, refer to [dedicating an agent](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/dedicating-an-agent-629015108.html).
  
  </details>

<details>
  <summary>4. What is the requirement for Remote agents?</summary><br>
Agency must ensure the Remote agents are clean and secure before SHIP-HATS approves the registration with Bamboo server.

  </details>
<details>
  <summary>5. What is a Shared Elastic agent? </summary><br>

A Shared Elastic agent is an on-demand Windows or Linux agent launched by Bamboo within SHIP&#39;s network to execute pipeline tasks. To leverage on elastic agent, Agency must specify the required capabilities and SHIP-HATS team will assign an agent that matches the required capabilities, if available.

SHIP-HATS does not offer Mac OS Agent as of now.

For more information on specifying required capabilities, refer to [Bamboo agent registration process](https://confluence.ship.gov.sg/display/SHIP/Bamboo+Agent+Registration+Process). This page is on SHIP-HATS confluence. Please log in to the account to access.
  </details>
 <details>
  <summary> 6. Which OS is available for the shared elastic agent?</summary><br>
Though MS Windows and Linux support, we recommend Linux as MS Window agents are quite heavy and would utilise a hefty load of Shared Agent hours. We recommend the Agency subscribe to Remote Agent if they choose MS Window agents.
  </details>
 <details>
  <summary>7. What tools are already installed on the Shared agents?</summary><br>

Refer to [SHIP Bamboo Elastic Agent for SHIP Users.](https://confluence.ship.gov.sg/display/SHIP/SHIP+Bamboo+Elastic+Agent+for+SHIP+Users) This page is on SHIP-HATS confluence. Please log in to the account to access.
