# Logging In and Logging Out 

**Prerequisites**: 

- Before you start, you must have been invited and onboarded to SHIP-HATS. 
- Once you have successfully onboarded, make sure that you have setup your OpenVPN connection. 

Once the above are successfully completed, you can proceed to log in to SHIP-HATS. Logging in tells the system who you are and what permissions you have in SHIP-HATS. For example, if you are a Subscription Admin or Project Admin, you can view the SHIP-HATS [**Dashboard** view](#viewing-dashboard) once you log in. Other “Users” will be directed to their [**Profile**](#viewing-profile-as-users) page.

?> Note: If you are SA or PA for more than one account and when you log in, by default, you will be viewing the subscription details of the first account to which you were added as SA or PA. Refer to **Switch account** to know about switching between accounts.

*To log in to SHIP-HATS:*

1. Go to [SHIP-HATS portal](https://www.ship.gov.sg/).
2. Click **Log In**.

## [Viewing Dashboard](#viewing-dashboard)
The **Overview** page of the subscription account gives the dashboard view of the subscription account. Only Subscription Admin (SA) and Project Admin (PA) can access this dashboard to view the following details.

- Subscription tier for the Billing Account
- [Plan details](https://docs.developer.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-documentation/#/portal-guide/account-management/account-management?id=viewing-plan-details)
- Count of projects hosted on this account
- Count of users added to this account
- Projects using shared Bamboo agents and their usage quota.

?> Note: The term **Overview** and **Dashboard view** may be used interchangeably.
