# Logging In and Logging Out 

**Prerequisites**: 

- Before you start, you must have been invited and onboarded to SHIP-HATS. 
- Once you have successfully onboarded, make sure that you have setup your OpenVPN connection. 

Once the above are successfully completed, you can proceed to log in to SHIP-HATS. 

Logging in tells the system who you are and what permissions you have in SHIP-HATS. For example, if you are a Subscription Admin or Project Admin, you can view the SHIP-HATS Dashboard once you log in. Other “Users” will be directed to their profile page.

*To log in to SHIP-HATS:*

1. Go to [SHIP-HATS portal](https://www.ship.gov.sg/).
2. Click **Log In**.
