# Logging In and Logging Out

**Prerequisites**:

- Before you start, you must have been invited and onboarded to SHIP-HATS.
- Once you have successfully onboarded, make sure that you have setup your OpenVPN connection.

## Logging In
Once the above are successfully completed, you can proceed to log in to SHIP-HATS. Logging in tells the system who you are and what permissions you have in SHIP-HATS. For example, if you are a Subscription Admin or Project Admin, you can view the SHIP-HATS [**Dashboard**](#viewing-dashboard) view once you log in. Other “Users” will be directed to their [**Profile**](#viewing-profile-as-users) page.

**Note**

 - If you are the SA or PA for a subscription account and when you log in, by default, you will be viewing the subscription details of the first account to which you were added as SA or PA.

 - SA and PA must log in to SonarQube before proceeding to create applications in SonarQube. Though only SA and PA can create applications in SonarQube, we recommend all users to log in to SonarQube at least once to ease the process if a user role is changed to a PA role in the future.

Refer to [**Switch account**](#switch-account) to know how to switch between different subscription accounts.

## [Viewing Dashboard](#viewing-dashboard)

- Count of projects hosted on this account
- Count of users added to this account
