# User Management 
This section describes the following: 
* Invite Users 
* Approve New Users 
* View Users 
* Remove User 
* Reactivate User 


## Invite Users 
Subscription Administrator (SA) and Project Admin (PA) can invite and add users to the subscription. Note that only SA can add a user as PA to their SHIP-HATS projects. 

*To invite users:*

1. Log in to <a href="https://www.ship.gov.sg/"> SHIP-HATS portal </a> and ensure you are in the required account. If needed, refer to Switch account. 

From the side menu, click **Users > Invite Users**. An invitation link is automatically generated.  

By default, a new invitation link has a 14 days expiry date.  Whenever you invite new users, the same link will be displayed with the remaining expiry date until it expires. In the example below, SA invites a new user to SHIP-HATS. As the invite was created 2 days earlier, the link is valid for the next 12 days.
