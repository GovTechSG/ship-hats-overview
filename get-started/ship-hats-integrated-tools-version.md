- Visit our Confluence page on [Purple HATS](https://confluence.ship.gov.sg/display/HATSKB/Purple+HATS) to know more about how to use it.

- As the pCloudy web dashboard needs proxy settings configured in your browser, we recommend you use Firefox to use pCloudy so that these proxy settings do not impact your system&#39;s proxy. For more information, visit [pCloudy Onboarding guide for SHIP-HATS](https://confluence.ship.gov.sg/display/HATSKB/pCloudy+Onboarding+Guide).
