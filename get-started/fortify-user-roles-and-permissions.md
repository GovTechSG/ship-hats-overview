# Fortify User Roles and Permissions

User roles and their permissions determine the actions a user can perform in Fortify Software Security Center (SSC). Fortify as a COTS product comes with system defined roles and permissions. We have customised these system-defined roles and permissions to meet your requirements.

The following table lists the roles and permissions available on Fortify with SHIP-HATS. The Project Admin (PA) can:

- Assign or unassign roles to users excluding other PAs for each Fortify application.
- View and edit application version.
- Remove applications.
- Increase Fortify quota.
- Retrieve token from SHIP-HATS portal to setup Bamboo pipeline.

<!--Refer to **Manage user role in Fortify applications** for more information.-->

Note:

- To run dynamic scans, the user must either have a **User** or **Manager** [role in WebInspect (WIE)](https://confluence.ship.gov.sg/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=HATSKB&amp;title=WebInspect+User+Access+Control).
- PAs can refer to [WIE service request guidelines](https://confluence.ship.gov.sg/display/HATSKB/WebInspect+Service+Tickets+Guide) and raise service request to add users and assign roles in WIE. You can access these pages only if you have access to Confluence in your organisation.
